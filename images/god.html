    <h1 class="h1">God</h1>
<p>
  In monotheistic thought, God is conceived of as the supreme being, creator, and principal object of faith. God is usually conceived of as being omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent and omnibenevolent as well as having an eternal and necessary existence. ... In pantheism, God is the universe itself.
